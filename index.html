<p>This page serves as practice for me to make a website. I will share all notes that I take for the Security+ 701 exam. I take no credit for the material, as I used many different sources to compile this. Please feel free to use the notes as you please. Listed below are different points that can be taken from this.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learn different acronyms used in Security.</li>
	<li>Understand the objectives that are found in the exam.</li>
	<li>Understand the material to pass the exam and find a Security position.</li>
</ul>
